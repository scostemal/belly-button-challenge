# Interactive Web Visualizations with D3.js

## Overview
This project aims to visualize and interact with microbiome data extracted from a JSON file. Utilizing D3.js for DOM manipulations and Plotly.js for creating interactive charts, we showcase the top 10 bacterial cultures found in biological samples and explore their distribution. The visualization includes a dynamic bar chart and a bubble chart, which update based on the user's selection from a dropdown menu. Additionally, metadata related to the selected sample is displayed, providing further insights into the data.

## Features
- Dropdown menu to select different samples.
- Bar chart visualization for the top 10 bacterial cultures found.
- Bubble chart visualization for the distribution of all bacterial cultures in a sample.
- Display of metadata information for the selected sample.
